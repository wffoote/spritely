/**
 * A SpriteWindow is a frame for displaying a grid of equal-sized tiles
 * in an animation.  This is the main entry point for the Spritely
 * framework.
 * <p>
 * Tiles may overlap, that is, each position on the grid may have multiple
 * tiles.  Each tile has both a graphical representation and a text
 * representation; in text mode, only the topmost tile can be seen.  Programs
 * may contain multiple SpriteWindow instances.
 * <p>
 * The basic lifecycle of a SpriteWindow application is as follows:
 * <pre>
 *    SpriteWindow window = new SpriteWindow(...);
 *    window.setXXX() (frames/second, callbacks, etc.)
 *    window.start();
 *    while (window.isRunning()) {
 *        update any needed data structures
 *        AnimationFrame frame = window.waitForNextFrame();        
 *        if (frame == null) {   // Stopped
 *            break;
 *        }
 *        if (there might be a change to show in this animation frame) {
 *            call frame.addTile(x, y, Tile) for the displayed tiles;
 *            window.showNextFrame();
 *        }
 *        do anything else you want to do
 *        if (you're done with window) {
 *            window.stop();
 *        }
 *    }
 *    System.exit(0);
 * </pre>
 * You are not required to have a single "event loop" like this, however.
 * You can call window.waitForNextFrame() and window.showFrame() whenever 
 * you want to within your program, as long as you don't try to call it
 * from a mouse or keyboard handler.  It will
 * only call your callbacks during a call to showNextFrame(), so you
 * don't need to handle multi-threading.
 * <p>
 * This style of animation creates a new frame, some number of times per
 * second (controlled by the frames/second value you set).  This frees you
 * from having to track if things have changed; you just fill up a frame
 * object with the current state of the world every time the framework is
 * ready for you.  Don't worry too much about wasting CPU time.  This kind
 * of animation is usually done on a personal computer, where you have CPU
 * power to burn.  Also, in a real program that features motion, something
 * usually changes every frame anyway.  Besides, Spritely is pretty good at
 * figuring out similarities between two animation frames, and only painting
 * what has changed.
 * <p>
 * It's expected that you won't have multiple windows, but you can.  This 
 * would be questionable in text mode, though.  In graphics mode, if you
 * want multiple frames, you can run each window from its own thread, or you
 * can arrange to call showNextFrame on the multiple frame objects, one
 * after the other, from the same thread.
 * <p>
 * This framework can also be used when animation isn't continuous, e.g.
 * in turn-based games.  In this case, fps gives a maximum number of
 * frames/second, which might be useful for periods when there is no
 * user input.  In this case, calling <code>pauseAnimation(0)</code>
 * before <code>waitForNextFrame()</code> will reset the animation clock.
