/**
 * An AnimationController controls the timing aspects on an animation.
 * It is used internally in spritely, but it can also be used by client
 * code to control any kind of frame-based animation.  For example, you
 * can use AnimationController to control animation on a 
 * <code>java.awt.Canvas</code> object that is embedded in a widget
 * hierarchy.  To use it in this way, something like the following
 * would work:
 * <pre>
 *
 *    Canvas canvas = ...;
 *    AnimationController controller = new AnimationController();
 *    controller.setXXX() (frames/second, etc.)
 *    controller.setOpened();  // Assuming canvas has been opened
 *    controller.start();
 *    while (controller.isRunning()) {
 *        update any needed data structures
 *        if (controller.waitForNextFrame()) {
 *            break;
 *        }
 *        Draw the next frame into a buffer;
 *        Copy that buffer to canvas, e.g. using java.awt.image.BufferStrategy
 *        do anything else you want to do
 *        if (you're done with this animation) {
 *            controller.stop();
 *        }
 *    }
 * </pre>
