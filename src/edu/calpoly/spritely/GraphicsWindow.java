/**
 * A GraphicsWindow is a frame for displaying graphical animation.  This
 * is an alternate entry point for the Spritely framework.  It removes
 * the restriction of animating a grid, but it does not give the option
 * of a text mode.  It is also more complicated in some ways.
 * <p>
 * The basic lifecycle of a GraphicsWindow application is as follows:
 * <pre>
 *    GraphicsWindow window = new GraphicsWindow(...);
 *    window.setXXX() (frames/second, callbacks, etc.)
 *    window.start();
 *    while (window.isRunning()) {
 *        update any needed data structures
 *        Grahpics2D g = window.waitForNextFrame();        
 *        if (g == null) {   // Stopped
 *            break;
 *        }
 *        call Graphics2D methods on g to draw frame
 *        window.showNextFrame();
 *        do anything else you want to do
 *        if (you're done with window) {
 *            window.stop();
 *        }
 *    }
 *    System.exit(0);
 * </pre>
 * You are not required to have a single "event loop" like this, however.
 * You can call frame.waitForNextFrame() and frame.showFrame() whenever 
 * you want to within your program, as long as you don't try to call it
 * from a mouse or keyboard handler.  It will
 * only call your callbacks during a call to showNextFrame(), so you
 * don't need to handle multi-threading.
 * <p>
 * This style of animation creates a new frame, some number of times per
 * second (controlled by the frames/second value you set).  This frees you
 * from having to track if things have changed; you just fill up a frame
 * object with the current state of the world every time the framework is
 * ready for you.  Don't worry too much about wasting CPU time.  This kind
 * of animation is usually done on a personal computer, where you have CPU
 * power to burn.  Also, in a real program that features motion, something
 * usually changes every frame anyway.  If you really want to optimize 
 * painting, check out <code>paintLastFrameTo(java.awt.Graphics2D)</code>.
 * <p>
 * It's expected that you won't have multiple windows, but you can.
 * You can run each window from its own thread, or you
 * can arrange to call showNextFrame on the multiple frame objects, one
 * after the other, from the same thread.
 * <p>
 * This framework can also be used when animation isn't continuous, e.g.
 * in turn-based games.  In this case, fps gives a maximum number of
 * frames/second, which might be useful for periods when there is no
 * user input.  In this case, calling <code>pauseAnimation(0)</code>
 * before <code>waitForNextFrame()</code> will reset the animation clock.
